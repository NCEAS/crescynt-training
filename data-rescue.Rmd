# Welcome

Welcome to [CRESCYNT](https://www.earthcube.org/group/crescynt-coral-reef-science-cyberinfrastructure-network)'s [**Data Science for Coral Reefs Workshop 1: Data Rescue**](http://crescyntblog.org/2017/12/22/crescynt-workshop-1-data-rescue), hosted at [NCEAS](https://nceas.ucsb.edu/) in Santa Barbara, California, from March 12-15, 2018.

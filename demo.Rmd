## Demo these things:

- naming chunks
- `message=FALSE`
- `warning=FALSE`
- `eval=FALSE`
- `echo=FALSE`
- `results='hide'`
- `child="another_rmarkdown.Rmd"`
- Help > Cheatsheets > RMarkdown (there are 2!)

- revert files from git tab


```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # install.packages('tidyverse')
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, child="another_rmarkdown.Rmd"}

```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

Hide results but still evaluate
```{r cars, results='hide'}
x <-  3
x
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
x
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
